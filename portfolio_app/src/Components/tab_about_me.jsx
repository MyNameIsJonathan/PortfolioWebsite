                I grew up in the service industry, spent time working in
                biochemical research, and have been learning software
                engineering for just over two years.

              <span className="information-textâ‰ˆborder">
                I love playing hockey, making (and drinking) coffee, playing the
                drums, woodworking, playing board games, and going to the beach.
                With experience across the stack, I love everything from scaling
                backend infrastructures on AWS and GCP to heavily optimizing
                React state updates/re-rendering.
